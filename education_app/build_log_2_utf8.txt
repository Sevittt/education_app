Alternatively, use the flag "--android
-skip-build-dependency-validation" to 
bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP 
version is typically defined in the 
plugins block of the 
`settings.gradle` file (D:\Workshop\ed
ucation_app\education_app\android/sett
ings.gradle), by a plugin with the id 
of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, 
your project was likely created with 
an older template version, in which 
case it is most likely defined in the 
top-level build.gradle file (D:\Worksh
op\education_app\education_app\android
/build.gradle) by the 
ext.kotlin_version property.
